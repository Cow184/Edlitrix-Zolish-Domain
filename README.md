🎭 Mission Statement: Built for the Stage, Not the Spreadsheet This project was created to solve a problem that plagues drama departments, community theaters, and independent troupes: the "Subscription Tax" on creativity. Modern theatrical production is complex, and while there are many tools available to manage the workflow, most are owned by companies that prioritize monthly fees over the art itself. This software exists to provide a professional-grade organization system that remains: Accessible: No paywalls, no "premium tiers," and no subscriptions. Transparent: Built by someone who cares about theater, for people who make theater happen. Community-Owned: Because this code is licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, it can never be "bought out" or locked behind a paywall. It belongs to the theater community. My goal is simple: To give schools and troupes the tools they need to spend less time managing spreadsheets and more time under the lights.

🛠️ How You Can Use This Schools & Universities: Use this to manage your entire season's production calendar and tech notes for free. Community Theaters: Keep your volunteer teams organized without eating into your costume or set budget. Developers: Help me grow this! If you have ideas to make the theater world better, your contributions are welcome—provided they stay free for everyone.
